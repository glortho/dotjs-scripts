mail.google.com.js
------------------

- Currently just for Google Voice users who send and receive SMS by email. This adds a character count box above the body textarea so you know how many out of the 160 max you've used.
	

facebook.com.js
---------------

- Removes ads and other junk in the right column. An ugly interval hack right now. Don't use this until it's refined.
